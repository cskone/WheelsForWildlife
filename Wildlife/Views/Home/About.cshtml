<p>
    Founded in 2012, the Wheels for Wildlife (W4W) Program is a 
    volunteer-based transport team that expedites the response 
    process for wildlife needing medical treatment and rehabilitative 
    care. All species of native birds and the Hawaiian hoary bat are 
    transported and volunteers on all islands are welcomed to join.

    There is no pressure or requirement to carry out transports.
    When we need a transport, we put out the call to our W4W volunteers
    to see who is up for the mission. If you’re unavailable, no worries!
    We will move on to the next volunteer for that transport.
